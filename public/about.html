<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am an IT Help Desk Technician and I want to transition to become a developer or web developer. I know it's kind
  of tough to learn programming alone, but I guess everything will pay off eventually. It will be a long path, but I should
  have faith in myself that I can do it.
</p>

<p>So right now, I am trying my best to be productive and learn more. The reason why I chose the programming path in the tech
  industry is that, first, it provides a high salary and, second, there are many opportunities for learning and growth. I am
  not saying that I don't love my current job, which is Help Desk, but I feel like I am stuck and not learning or growing anymore.
  I believe that Web Development is the best way to start programming, and my goal is to become a full-stack developer but for
  now, I will start with front-end development.
</p>

<p>This is my first portfolio, and I may need to revise it soon. Right now, I need to focus on learning first, and then I can add
  all the projects and learning experiences I have gained
